* Provides an overview of the structure of the programming language files
* Automatically opens popup menu for completions when you enter characters or move the cursor in Insert mode
* Comment stuff out.  Use `gcc` to comment out a line (takes a count), `gc` to comment out the target of a motion
* Visually browse complex directory hierarchies, quickly open files for reading or editing, and perform basic file system operations.
* Search with ack from within Vim and shows the results in a split window
* Syntastic checker for almost every programming language

// Shortcuts without ;
e               // Delete word under cursor
tabc            // Close tab, of course you should :tabnew a file first. 
F1              // Compile cpp code, and make sure there is a diretory named "bin" in current directory.
gc              // Comment out the target of a motion
gcc             // Comment out a line (takes a count)
{               // Up block of code 
}               // Down block of code

# FAQ

PowerVim do not install youcompleteme to perfect code completion

* PowerVim basic code completion is enough
* Installing youcompleteme is complicated and is not almost universal, one install successfully do not mean other people can install it successfully in same operation method.
* Open vim will be slow. Because youcompleteme is to large, it load bin file and analyze syntax.
* PowerVim will try it latter, if it is easy to install and use.

# Todo

* Check whether ctags are installed when installing PowerVim
* Check directory bin when Compiling CPP
